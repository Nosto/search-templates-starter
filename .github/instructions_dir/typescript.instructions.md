# TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use closures over classes
- Utilize type inference in return types, except for functions with multiple return statements
- Use utility types to derive types from constants
- Use const (and let) over var
- Use async/await instead of Promise chaining
- Use individual named exports over bulk exports
- Favor named exports over default exports
- Avoid using `any` in TypeScript; prefer specific types or `unknown`
- Use ES2020 level features and syntax conventions
- Favor functional programming style with array methods like map, filter, reduce, etc.
- **Avoid adding unnecessary comments** - only add comments when explicitly instructed or when complex logic needs explanation
